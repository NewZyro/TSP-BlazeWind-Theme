# BlazeWind Theme for Trimui Smart Pro
This is a theme for crossmix based on an unreleased game of mine.

I used XCmixer's CrossmixRAW theme and the default Trimui theme as bases for this.

Emulator icons are edited versions of branperryqc's Nintendo Switch theme, wich in turn is based on lilbud's RetroPie Switch theme.

I also included some base templates for building your own icons.
